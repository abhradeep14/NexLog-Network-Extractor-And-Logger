# NexLog ‚Äì Intelligent Network Flow Monitoring

**NexLog** is a lightweight, high-performance service that captures and analyzes network traffic flows at a deep level using raw socket inspection. It operates silently in the background, turning raw packet data into rich, structured, and actionable insights.

---

## üöÄ Features
- üì¶ **Raw Socket Capture** ‚Äì Directly inspects packets at the IP level with minimal overhead.
- üîç **Flow-Based Analysis** ‚Äì Aggregates packets into flows, tracking:
  - Protocol types (TCP/UDP/ICMP)
  - TCP flag behavior (SYN, ACK, FIN, etc.)
  - Byte counts, durations, and inter-packet timing
  - DNS queries
  - Entropy-based payload characterization
- üß† **JSON Lines Logging** ‚Äì Logs each flow as a timestamped JSON object for easy parsing and streaming.
- üß∞ **Configurable** ‚Äì Output path, rotation policy, server sync, and logging level are fully customizable.
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Server Integration** ‚Äì Optionally sends logs to a remote server for centralized analysis.
- üîá **Silent Operation** ‚Äì No UI, no prompts ‚Äî just quiet, continuous monitoring.
- üîç **Anomaly Detection** ‚Äì Basic heuristic-based anomaly detection for suspicious network patterns.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Download the source files (`nexlog.c` and `nexlog.h`).

2. Build (Windows):
   ```bash
   cl.exe /W3 /D_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS /Fenexlog.exe nexlog3.c /link ws2_32.lib iphlpapi.lib wininet.lib advapi32.lib
   ```
   
   Or with MinGW GCC:
   ```bash
   gcc -o nexlog.exe nexlog.c -lws2_32 -liphlpapi -lwininet -ladvapi32
   ```

3. Install as a Windows service:
   ```bash
   nexlog.exe -install
   ```

4. The default configuration file is created at the executable's location. Edit `nexlog.conf` to customize settings.

5. Start the service:
   ```bash
   nexlog.exe -start
   ```
